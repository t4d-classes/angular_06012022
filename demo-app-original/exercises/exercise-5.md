Exercise 5

1. Copy the code for Car Edit Row to your solution.

2. In the Car View Row, add an Edit button to the actions column. When the button is clicked, that row changes to an edit row. Only ONE row is editable at a time. Design your data structures accordingly. Do not support multiple edit rows in your data structure.

3. Fully implement the save and cancel buttons on Car Edit Row.

Hint: Save - Cars array copy using "concat", "findIndex" to find the car Index, and then replace the car in the copy with edited car, and set the copy to the cars property of Car Home.

4. Ensure it works!
